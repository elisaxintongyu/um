    C Interfaces and Implementations by David R. Hanson
 
Architecture:

We implemented:
um.c           - contains the implementation of um class.
um.h           - contains three functions that initialize, execute (fetch, 
                 decode, execute cycle) andt free the memory of um.
SegMem.c       - contains the impementation of the SegMem class.
SegMem.h       - contains functions that give access and free each segment and
                 functions that store or load elements in the segmented memory.
main.c         - contains a main that passes in the input and output devices 
                 and calls function in the um class to initialize, execute and
                 free memory of um. 
test_main.c    - a testing main used to test for the functions in the SegMem 
                 class.

Implementation:

    Implemented the whole of the SegMem and um class.  
    Created a testing main for testing SegMem and um instruction files to test 
    the completed um. 
    We expect all implementation to work as expected.

Significant departures from the design doc:
    - we changed what we used to think about program counter. We realized that
      it doesn't have to be a pointer, intead we used the index of the inner
      sequence (the instruction number) of the 0 segment to represent the 
      program counter
      
    - We changed some architectures of SegMem. We changed the next_id to curr_id
      which would be less confusing to implement and more straightforward. 
      We added a function in SegMem to get the length of specific segement with
      segment id for traversing segments in um.c in LOADP instruction

    - Changed the data structure of registers from uarray to sequences, for 
      easier access and storing of elements.

    - Included much more specific testings for both SegMem and unit testing 
      instruction files. 
    
Time taken UM to execute 50 million instructions, and how do we know:


Mentions each UM unit test (from UMTESTS) by name, explaining what each one 
tests and how:

halt.um             - a halt test with a single halt that makes sure the program
                      ends with no memory loss.

halt-verbose.um     - test if the halt works successfully to halt the program 
                      entirely; if it works, it will not print the word "BAD!"

activate.um         - test for the map segment instruction; create a segment 
                      of 10 elements and check that the id returned is 1 by 
                      adding the returned value to 58, which gives ; in the 
                      ASCII table.

cmove0.um           - test cmov instruction when 0 is in $r[C]; load values into
                      corresponding registers and output the register that is
                      assigned to assert that no assignment is done.

cmove1.um           - test cmov instruction when 1 is in $r[C]; load values into
                      corresponding registers and output the register that is
                      assigned to assert that the cmov performed. 

inactivate.um       - test for the unmap segment instruction; first create a 
                      segment of 33 elements and store a value 58 in it by using
                      sstore; then it
                      inactivates (unmap) the segment that was just created; 
                      then it activates (map) the same segment again, and 
                      store a new value 66 in the segment; next, we gets the 
                      value that was just stored by using sload; finally prints
                      B, which is the ASCII of the new value 66.

divide.um           - test if add instruction works as instended; if it works,
                      it will print !

multiply.um         - test if multiply instruction works as instended; 
                      if it works, it will print 8

print-six.um        - test if add instruction works as instended; if it works,
                      it will print 6

nand.um             - Populate a resgister with all 1 bits by performing nand on
                      an empty register. Populate another resgister with the 
                      reversed bits of unsigned 33. Perform nand on these two 
                      registers and store in r3. Print r3 and assert that it 
                      prints !, which is 33 in ASCII.

arith.um            - a test that contains all the arithmatic instructions like
                      add, multiply, divide, and nand, to see if they can work
                      well together

seg.um              - Tests for storing and loading in a newly mapped segment; 
                      create a new segment of 10 elements and store 58 in 
                      $m[1][1] and load it from the same location and store 
                      the value retrieved to another unused register. Output 
                      the register and make sure it prints the ASCII 58, that 
                      is :

sstore.um           - tests the sstore function (storing element into segmem) 
                      by calling sstore without outputting anything. Check that
                      no error is thrown.

sload.um            - after testing sstore, tests sload by calling sload an 
                      outputting the result. Specifically, we map a new segment 
                      and store 65 into $m[1][0] and we load it immediately 
                      into another register and output it. It should print A, 
                      which is ASCII 65.

times2.um           - Tests for input from I/O device and times the input by 2 
                      by adding it to itself and output the result. Check if the
                      output is the same as expected.

times3.um           - Tests for input from I/O device and times the input by 2 
                      by calling multiply funcition and output the result. 
                      Check if the output is the same as expected.
